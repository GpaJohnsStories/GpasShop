        <p>Hi ya —<br>
        I'm Grandpa John, and I want to share and suggest some stuff I've discovered over the years. Whether it's a children's book that made my grandkids laugh, a t-shirt with something fun on the front that actually holds up, or a devotional that spoke to my heart, I only recommend things I know personally.</p>

<p>When you click my links and buy something, the companies pay me a small commission. This doesn't cost you extra, but it helps me keep my free websites <b>GpasKids.com</b> and <b>GpasFaith.com</b> grow with more stories and encouragement. Think of it as dropping a coin in the jar by the register — except the jar supports my free and safe websites that help kids learn kindness and families grow in faith.</p>

<p>Browse around, and remember: these aren't just products, they're things I'd tell you about if we were neighbors just chatting over the fence.</p>
