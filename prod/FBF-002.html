    This book is designed to be read alongside <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i> (Gpa John's Code FBF-001), by Oswald Chambers. It fills in the gaps many of us feel when reading Oswald Chambers for the first time. <br><br>

It wasn’t until partway through my second time reading My Utmost that I began to really understand what Chambers was saying. By the third time through, I realized what a gem beyond price that book is. <br><br>

When I later started a Bible study using <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i> and added the <i>Daily Companion</i>, the difference was immediate. Each day’s entry follows the corresponding devotional reading and offers short, clear explanations, Scripture context, and practical application questions. <br><br>

The insights in this book are thoughtful without being heavy, and they help bring Chambers’ words into sharper focus. <br><br>

I honestly wish I had this book the first time I read <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>. Used together, these two books make a powerful and meaningful daily devotions.
