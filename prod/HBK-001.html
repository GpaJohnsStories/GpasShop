  This is the kind of book that settles into a family and stays there. <br>
<br>
Ralph Moody was only eight when his family moved from New Hampshire to a ranch southwest of Denver, Colorado — land that is now part of a town — but in these pages it’s still wide‑open country, full of hard work, grit, and the kind of growing‑up lessons that shape a life. <br>
<br>
I remember my mother reading this book to me once or twice when I was young, and years later my wife read it to our kids and then later to some of our grandkids. <br>
<br>
The story has that rare mix of honesty and adventure that keeps children listening and adults nodding along. <br>
<br>
This is the first book in Moody’s series, but it stands strong on its own. It’s a fine read‑aloud and a good reminder of courage, responsibility, and the quiet strength of family.
