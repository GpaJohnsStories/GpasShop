<p>I read <i>Little Britches: Father and I Were Ranchers</i> several times as a child. Other times, my mother read it to me. Years later, my wife and I found ourselves reading it aloud again — this time to our own children and later to some of our grandkids.</p>
<p>The story is told through the eyes of Ralph Moody, who was eight years old when his family moved from New Hampshire to a ranch in Colorado, southwest of Denver, in the early 1900s.</p>
<p>Life there was full of hard work and real adventure — roundups, auctions, family gatherings, irrigation troubles, sudden storms, and the everyday challenges of ranch life.</p>
<p>What makes this book special is how naturally it shows a boy growing up. Ralph learns to be responsible, to have courage, and to persevere as he helps his family. At times, he finds he has to step up in ways that surprise even him.</p>
<p>The writing is simple, honest, and full of warmth, making it easy for children to follow and enjoyable for adults to read aloud.</p>
<p>This is the first book in an eight‑book series, and while I’ve only read the first one myself, it stands beautifully on its own.</p>
<p>It’s a wonderful choice for grade‑school readers, family read‑aloud time, or any child who enjoys true stories filled with adventure, family, and character.</p></p><div style='margin:14px 0; text-align:center;'><a href='https://amzn.to/3NjRNrS' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' style='display:inline-block; padding:10px 21px; font-family:Lexend; font-size:18px; font-weight:bold; color:#fff; background:#2e7d32; border:4px solid #1b5e20; border-radius:999px; box-shadow:0 3px 0 #666; text-decoration:none;'>View Details</a></div><div style='font-family:Lexend; font-size:18px; font-weight:normal; color:#666; margin-top:10px;'>Tags: children, classic, family, read aloud, historical, true, pioneer, ranch, cattle, horses, growing up, character, wholesome american, west, early 20th century, 1900s, true, family values, cowboy, excitement</div></article>
